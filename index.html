      <h4 class="byline">By Chris Boggus, Tanisha Edwards</h4>

      <p>
        <strong>EAST LANSING</strong> - Bar crawling could not be easier in East Lansing.
        There are sixteen bars in downtown East Lansing's stretch on Grand River. On the
        perfect bar crawl for East Lansing, each bar is only a minute long walk&mdash;approximately
        a three-minute long crawl&mdash;away, or less.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are a proud bar star of East Lansing, then you know that the tour of EL usually
        starts on a Thursday somewhere like The Riv or P.T. O'Malley's, and will always end on
        the dance floor at Harper's, or in the infamous basement we call Rick's.
      </p>
      <p>
        No matter where the bar crawl starts, d&eacute;j&agrave; vu will creep up on you somewhere along the
        way. These bars define the drinkers of Michigan State University and if you are a visitor
        to the fine city of East Lansing, it would be an astronomical mistake to not include these
        top bars in your bar crawl.

      <div class="details">
        Sun: 9 a.m. &ndash; 12 a.m.

      <p>
        Beggar's Banquet bar has a new craft cocktail list along with daily specials, but the best
        time to go to Beggar's Banquet is for brunch to start your bar-crawl-belly off with a Bloody Mary.
        The experienced crawler will know that Beggars is the perfect place to start the East Lansing
        bar crawl&mdash;and the best place to nurse your day after with a little hair of the dog.

      <p>
        Peanut Barrel is the next destination on your list for lunchtime. The Barrel is chill and comfortable
        on the inside and has one of the premiere patios in the East Lansing bar scene. Hang outside and catch
        some sun or stay inside to enjoy a game of darts while you wait for your food and drinks. Look no further
        than Peanut Barrel's Long Islands and Reuben to end the early part of your crawl. It is helpful that the
        staff at Peanut Barrel cuts you off after two Long Island's&mdash;and there is a reason for that, they're goooooood.

      <p>
        Throw on your favorite jersey if your bar crawl is on a Thursday because you lucked out with the &ldquo;Burgerama&rdquo;
        special from noon until 9 p.m. when burgers go for $1.50, fries for $1 and pitchers of Coors Light beer are
        $4.25. The Riv recently earned the title of No. 1 Coors Light distributor in the nation because of Burgerama
        &mdash; just be prepared for the lines. It is recommended that The Riv is lunch/post-lunch destination for the EL
        bar crawl; enjoy the open-floor for a game of pool or giant Jenga, but be careful if you <strong>are</strong>
        there on a Thursday, because you might lose track of time dancing and boozing in your dad's Yzerman Jersey.

        Stop in and have a casual drink, catch the Spartans' game with friends or finish your night-out dancing to the
        best playlist around on the dance floor. If you are feeling lucky&mdash;and a little risky&mdash;take a chance on P.T.'s
        shot wheel. P.T.'s is always sure to pull crowds every Thursday with “Burger Bash,” arrive early to get your
        fill of tasty burgers and wash it all down with some delicious domestic pitchers. P.T.'s chemical balance
        competes with The Riv in terms of fun and comfortability, which is why these two bars are the best place to
        really start your turn-up!

        “On to the next one,” is what your crawlin' mates are shouting to you, but you are smart enough to know that
        the group could all use a little bit more food in their system. Hopcat provides the largest selection of craft
        beer in East Lansing, whether it's common local favorites being enjoyed on draft, or small batch specialties;
        HopCat's 100 taps will have something for everyone. Complementing the beer selection is a long menu of fantastic
        food; choose from a list of specialty burgers, exceptional sandwiches or have a basket of the award winning Crack
        Fries. It is here at Hopcat where your party will fuel up for the back half of their East Lansing adventure. Be
        sure to shovel as many Crack Fries into your mouth as possible, because if you don't, the guy next to you will.
        This relaxed atmosphere is poised for a great dinner that will send you off into the night scene of downtown
        East Lansing.

        &ldquo;Get the buckets,&rdquo; is what <em>they</em> say. The buckets of tots are to die for, and if you partake in one-too-many
        buckets of beer with your group, you may be crawling home sooner than you think; it is exactly what you think, a
        bucket full of beer. Rally your troops down to Crunchy's and you might not leave for another bar. This bar is
        cozy and a bit on the outside of downtown EL, but you could use that three-minute walk to burn off that entire
        bucket of beer you and your buddies just consumed.

        This Irish Pub is the sending-off point for the end of your night in East Lansing. It is here where you meet up
        with the crawlers from your group that couldn't manage the walk to Crunchy's. Dublin's hearty appetizers will be
        your last chance to get something to eat before blacking out; try their spinach artichoke dip or their Dublin hush
        puppies. Treat yourself to some delicious Irish Car Bombs before you manage your way down the steps of Dublin Square.

        Live DJs keep the party going all weekend, so your bar crawl can enjoy the wide open dance floor and home-brewed
        beers that make Harper's one of the most attractive downtown bars to close out the night. It's almost the end
        of the night, so if you don't already have that squinty-eye and that lean going-on, then top off your thirst with
        a Cat's Pajamas or a Long Island. And don't get discouraged looking up at the steep stairway leading into Harper's…
        but be careful on your way down.

      <p>
        It really is a toss-up for the end of the night destination; you can go to Harper's and then make your way to
        Rick's to round out at 2 a.m., but sometimes it is best to just go straight to Rick's&mdash; it's been a staple stop for
        any night out. Step into the underground bar and be prepared for dancing, good vibes and plenty of live DJs spinning
        your favorite tracks. Everyone who is anyone can be spotted late night at Rick's so no matter what your night
        entails, just make sure that at one point you go straight to Rick's.
